# Android Programming Labs Overview

This repository contains a series of Android programming labs exploring various aspects of utilizing external data sources in Android applications, covering topics from user interface development to data retrieval and processing. Below is an overview of each lab:

## Lab 1: DevTools and Compose UI Recap

- Provide a foundational understanding of Android development tools and Jetpack Compose for building user interfaces.
- Users work on a Compose UI application displaying "Hello World" and "2" strings along with a button.
- Key concepts include UI components, elevation, color definitions, and localization.

## Lab 2: Compose List or RecyclerView

- Guide exploration of Android app development for displaying lists of items and their details.
- Users have the choice of using Jetpack Compose or RecyclerView and Fragments for UI development.
- Key topics include navigation, fragment management, and data source handling.

## Lab 3: Networking and Threads

- Delve into networking and multithreading in Android apps.
- Users develop an app that downloads data from the web and presents it using a separate thread for communication.
- Major areas of focus include network permissions, thread management, and data retrieval.

## Lab 4: Coroutines

- Explore the use of Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- Users work with co-operating coroutines and tackle challenges present in the provided code.
- Core concepts encompass suspending functions, coroutine builders, and synchronization using Mutex.

## Lab 4b: Coroutines Net

- Extend understanding of coroutines by applying them to network operations, using lab 4 as base.
- Users create an application for communication with a Bluetooth LE device to retrieve data, such as heart rate information.
- Topics covered include coroutine-based Bluetooth communication and handling asynchronous data.

## Lab 5: Retrofit

- Introduce Retrofit, a popular library for making network requests in Android apps.
- Users develop an app that queries a web service's API (e.g., Wikipedia) to retrieve data (e.g., president information).
- Core areas include Retrofit setup, API calls, and JSON response parsing.

## Lab 5a: Room

- Learn about Android Room, a SQLite database library for Android apps.
- Users build an app with two related tables (e.g., football teams and players) and perform data insertion and retrieval.
- Key topics covered encompass entity definition, DAO creation, and database operations.

## Lab 6: Beacon

- Explore Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology by scanning for BLE devices around a phone.
- Participants develop an app that lists discovered devices, including device names, MAC addresses, and signal strength.
- Concepts covered include BLE scanning, permissions, and device emulation.

## Lab 7: Bluetooth

- Provide guidance in establishing a connection to a BLE device that provides a specific service (e.g., Heart Rate Service).
- Users enable notifications from the service and start receiving and displaying relevant data.
- Key areas include Bluetooth device selection, notifications, and data transfer.

## Lab 8: Graph

- Focus on visualizing data as a graph.
- Users collect data (e.g., Heart Rate measurements) and visualize it as a graph within the app.
- Major themes include data collection, passing data between UI components, and utilizing graph libraries.

These labs offer a comprehensive overview of Android app development, covering essential topics related to external data sources, networking, and sensor-based applications. They are designed to provide practical experience in building real-world Android applications.
